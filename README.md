# My Three.js Journey

Hello there! This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with Three.js.
I am excited to explore the world of 3D programming and share my progress here.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured to accommodate the different modules of the course.
Here's how it works:

## Main Branch

The main branch of this repository contains all the modules of the course,
each in its own directory. This way, all the course content is easily accessible and organized.

## Modules

Each module of the course is contained in its own separate directory in the main branch.
To access the content for a specific module, you just need to navigate to the
corresponding directory.

For example, if you want to access the content for Module 1, you would navigate
to the directory named `Module-1`.

This structure allows for each module to be isolated in its own environment,
preventing any conflicts between different parts of the course.

## Branches

Branches are used to work on updates or improvements to individual modules
without affecting the main, stable version of the course. Once the changes 
are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.

Remember, these are just guidelines and the best approach depends on your
specific needs and workflow.

Module 1 and 2 do not exist they are just an awesome introduction to the course.
