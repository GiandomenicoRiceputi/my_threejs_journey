# My Threejs Journey

# Thanks to Bruno Simon for this amazing course:  @bruno_simon , https://threejs-journey.com/, https://bruno-simon.com/ .

This repository is structured in a unique way to accommodate the different modules of the course. Here's how it works:

## Main Branch

The main branch of this repository contains only this `README.md` file. It serves as a guide to understand the structure and purpose of this repository.

## Course Modules

Each module of the course is contained in its own separate branch. To access the content for a specific module, you will need to switch to the corresponding branch.

For example, if you want to access the content for Module 1, you would switch to the branch named `Module-1`.

This structure allows for each module to be isolated in its own environment, preventing any conflicts between different parts of the course.

Remember to always switch back to the main branch before moving on to the next module.
Module 1 and 2 do not exist they are just an awesome introduction to the course.
